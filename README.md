##  Project Overview

This project demonstrates:
- **License Plate Detection:** using YOLO-V8 to accurately locate license plates within images or video frames.
- **Text Extraction:** using EasyOCR to recognize and extract alphanumeric text from the cropped license plate regions.
- **Real-time Processing:** designed for live detection on video streams or webcam feeds.
